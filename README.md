# Microsoft-Dev274x-Introduction-to-Python-Unit-2
This course is focussed on Python data structures, and work with string, list, and range sequences. Discover the power of list iteration, and learn about string and list methods. From there, get the details on file input and output--open files, read them, add to them, close them, and more. At the end of the course, you'll be able to slice strings into substrings, create lists, iterate through them, import files, and use file append mode, along with a lot of other practical Python tasks. This will put your analytical skills to test
